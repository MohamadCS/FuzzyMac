## Install 

### Precompiled binary
You can install it using homebrew

```bash
brew tap MohamadCS/FuzzyMac https://github.com/MohamadCS/FuzzyMac.git
brew install --cask MohamadCS/FuzzyMac/fuzzymac
```

**NOTE**: This will install qt@6 also, for now.

or by navigating to the releases section.
#### Damaged Binary ?
Solution
```shell
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/FuzzyMac.app

```

### üõ†Ô∏è Building from Source

#### ‚úÖ Requirements
-	macOS with Homebrew
-	Qt 6 installed via Homebrew:
```
brew install qt@6
```

#### üî® Build with CMake

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build .
```

This builds both the CLI and GUI versions.


###  üñ•Ô∏è CLI Mode

FuzzyMac can be used directly from the command line:

- Generate a list of entries using some command
- Pip those entries to FuzzyMac
- FuzzyMac will popup the search window
- After choosing an entry FuzzyMac prints out the result to stdout.

**Example**
```bash

app=$(fd --max-depth 1 -e app . /Applications -x realpath | FuzzyMac)

	if [ -z "$app"]; then
	exit
	fi

	open -a "$app"

```

### üß≠ Application Mode

FuzzyMac runs as a background app, activated by default with ‚åò + Space.

- By default:
*	It searches for applications in default config.
*	Pressing <Space> in the input box switches to file search mode.
*   Pressing Ctrl-o on a file in file mode will search files in this directory (non-recursive search), you can press Ctrl-b to go one level below.


## üîç How It Works
I used a simple custom scoring algorithm.
(previous versions relied on spotlight's indexing, which was very slow for some reason).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration


You can configure FuzzyMac by creating a file at:

~/.config/FuzzyMac/config.toml

**NOTE**: For now copy the config and don't rely on a default one, I will add support for a default config later.

If a setting is not provided, it will fall back to the built-in default below.

## üîß Default Config

```toml
font = "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font"

border_size = 0
animations = true
corner_radius = 20 
info_panel = false
opacity = 0.97

[colors]
outer_border = "#545464"

[colors.results_list]
selection = "#545464"
selection_background = "#e2e1df"
text = "#545464"
background = "#f2f1ef"
scrollbar_color = "#545464"
scrollbar_hold_color = "#4d699b"


[colors.mode_label]
text = "#43436c"
background = "#f2f1ef"

[mode.apps]
dirs = [
  "/Applications/",
  "/System/Applications",

]
show_icons = true
